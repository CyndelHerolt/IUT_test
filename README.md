# IUT_test_technique
Symfony Initiation

This website is a technical test in order to -maybe- be recruited by my university for a work-study contract.
It started on june 3rd and must be finished by june 10th.
The instructions were to create a home page as well as a "departments" page using the Symfony framework -I had never used Symfony before-.

<h1>Symfony</h1>

I started by installing Symfony CLI -using a package manager- to create the project. 

<code>
symfony new IUT_test  
</code>

# IUT_test_technique
Symfony Initiation

This website is a technical test in order to -maybe- be recruited by my university for a work-study contract.
It started on june 3rd and must be finished by june 10th.
The instructions were to create a home page as well as a "departments" page using the Symfony framework -I had never used Symfony before-.

<h2>Start the project by installing Symfony</h2>

I started by installing Symfony CLI and Profiler -using a package manager- to create the project and work on it locally, then I checked if everything was OK -indeed it was-. 

<code>
  composer require --dev symfony/profiler-pack
</code>
<br>
<code>
  symfony new IUT_test
  cd C:/MAMP/localweb/IUT_test
  symfony server:start
</code>

I also installed the Symfony Support pluggin on PHPStorm.

<h2>Project structure discovery on PHPStorm</h2>

At first, this new environment was quite scary as it is unlike anything I have done before. But the Symfony docs helped me to understand the route and controller system.

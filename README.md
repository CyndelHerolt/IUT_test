# IUT_test_technique
Symfony Initiation

This website is a technical test in order to -maybe- be recruited by my university for a work-study contract.
It started on june 3rd and must be finished by june 10th.
The instructions were to create a home page as well as a "departments" page using the Symfony framework -I had never used Symfony before-.

<h1>Start the project by installing Symfony</h1>

I started by installing Symfony CLI -using a package manager- to create the project and work on it locally, then I checked if everything was OK -indeed it was-. 

<code>
symfony new IUT_test  
cd C:/MAMP/localweb/IUT_test
symfony server:start
</code>
